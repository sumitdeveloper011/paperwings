# BACKEND – NODE.JS

- Use clean layered architecture (routes, controllers, services)
- Keep routes thin; logic belongs in services
- Use async/await consistently
- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Handle errors centrally
- Avoid duplicated logic (extract helpers / utils)
- Never block the event loop
- Use environment variables properly
- Follow RESTful API standards
