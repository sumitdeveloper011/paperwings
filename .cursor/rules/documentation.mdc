# COMMENTING & DOCUMENTATION (6+ YEARS STYLE)

- Avoid unnecessary inline comments inside functions or methods
- Never explain obvious code with comments
- Do not narrate code line-by-line
- Prefer self-explanatory code with good naming
- Use DocBlocks (PHPDoc / JSDoc) for functions, methods, and services
- DocBlocks should describe purpose, parameters, and return values only
- Do not repeat implementation details in DocBlocks
- Avoid DocBlocks for simple private helpers unless necessary
- Comments are allowed only for complex business logic, edge cases, performance decisions, or non-obvious behavior
- If a comment is required to understand code, refactor the code first
- Comments should explain "why", not "what"
