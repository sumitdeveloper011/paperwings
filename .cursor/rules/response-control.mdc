# SUMMARY & RESPONSE CONTROL

- Do not provide summaries automatically after completing a task
- Do not add recap or "final summary" sections by default
- Provide a summary only when explicitly requested by the user
- Focus on delivering the task output, not explanations
- Avoid over-explaining unless asked
